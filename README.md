# BuzzFeed Headline Analysis

## Overview
This is a fun little project I built that takes top headlines from BuzzFeed, using the News.org API, collected over 20 days and attempts create new BuzzFeed-style headlines from a custom AI model! The project is broken down into a few different sections starting off with a dedicated data collection notebook, then a notebook containing the code to merge all of the collected data files, a headline analysis notebook and lastly a notebook for our NLP model.
