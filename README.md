# BuzzFeed Headline Analysis

This is a fun little project I built that takes top headlines from BuzzFeed, using the News.org API, collected over 20 days and attempts create new BuzzFeed-style headlines from a custom AI model! The project is broken down into a few different sections starting off with a dedicated data collection notebook, then a notebook containing the code to merge all of the collected data files, a headline analysis notebook and lastly a notebook for our NLP model.

## Data Collection & Merging ðŸ’»

To collect the headlines from BuzzFeed, I built a simple web scraper that utilized the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) API, the `requests` and `json` python libraries. The initial plan was to create a script that automated the scraping everyday but I couldn't quite figure that out so I manually ran the scraper for the 20 days of collection which worked just fine. Once I saved all of the csv files, I created a new notebook that loaded in the files via `glob` and just concatenated all of them together.
